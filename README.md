# CRICKET T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis

I worked on this Analysis and report-making project.
This project was done in Python Pandas, Power BI & SQL Server 


## Problem statement:

Here the main aim was to find the world team which can make at least 180 runs 
and then defend a total of 150 runs on an average


## Input And Resources:

1. Mockup dashboard which gives the outline of the dashboard as it appears.
2. Metrics and calculated columns list.
3. Parameters and Criteria on which the players are to be selected.

## Description:

In this project, I used the JSON source file, imported them in Python Pandas, and then cleaned the data.
After cleaning the data was saved as .csv files for further analysis work.
The analysis of the cleaned data was done in Microsoft Power BI.
Various metrics and calculated columns were created to get the required result.
Used IF and ISFILTERED functions to display or hide the text & metrics as required
Used buttons to navigate between different report pages.

I have also done the data cleaning and analysis in the Microsoft SQL server for crosschecking.
